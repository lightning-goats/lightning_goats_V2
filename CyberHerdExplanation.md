# Joining the CyberHerd: How It Works

## What is the CyberHerd?

The CyberHerd is a community of Nostr users who collectively support the ⚡Lightning Goats⚡ project. As a herd member, you'll receive a share of all payments sent to feed the goats every flippin time the feeder is triggered!

## How to Join the CyberHerd

The CyberHerd resets daily at 1:00 AM Mountain Time, creating a fresh opportunity to join each day:

1. Find the daily CyberHerd note on Nostr (it will have the CyberHerd tag)
2. Make sure you have the right note.
3. Repost that note
4. Send a zap to that note

Likes can't get you into the CyberHerd.

A zap or a repost will to secure your place in the herd. Make sure your Nostr profile has:

- A valid NIP-05 identifier (your verified Nostr address)
- A working Lightning address to receive payments

## How Payouts Work

Every time someone triggers the feeder and feeds the ⚡Lightning Goats⚡, 10 % of the trigger amount (10% of the sum of all payments sent to trigger the feeder during that trigger cycle) is split among all CyberHerd members:

- Reposting and sending the minimum zap guarantees you at least 1%
- Larger zaps = larger share: The more sats you zap to join, the larger your percentage of future payouts that day.
- Payouts depend entirely on how much the goats are fed.  No feedings = no payouts.
- BIG FEEDINGS = BIG PAYOUTS!
- Limited spots available: The CyberHerd has currently has maximum size of 5 members. 
- First come, first served: Once the herd is full, new members can only join if they ⚡headbutt⚡ out existing members...

## Payout Percentage Details

Your share of payments is determined by your contribution compared to other members:

- Minimum share: For now everyone gets at least a small percentage (1%).
- Proportional distribution: Larger portions go to members who zapped more sats to join
- When the herd is full, each member gets at least 1% of payments with the big zappers getting more

## The ⚡Headbutting⚡ Mechanism

When the CyberHerd reaches maximum capacity, we use a headbutting system that allows new members to join even when the herd is full:

- **How headbutting works**: If you want to join a full herd, you can now ⚡headbutt⚡ (bump) the member with the lowest zap contribution right out of the CyberHerd
- **Zap-based competition**: Only zaps can be used for headbutting
- **Minimum requirement**: Your zap must be at least 10 sats and must exceed the current lowest member's zap amount.  Big goats push out the little goats and eat more treats.  It's the way of nature
- **Example**: If the lowest member in the herd zapped 100 sats to join, you need to zap at least 110 sats to replace them.  If someone only joined with a repost, a small 10 sat zap and they're replaced
- **Notification system**: Both you and the member you replaced will receive a nip04 DM  about the headbutt.  If the headbut fails you should also get a DM.
- **Cooldown period**: After a headbutt, there's a one-minute cooldown before anyone can attempt another headbutt.
- **Darwinian order**: This mechanism ensures active and higher-contributing members maintain their spots
- **Strategy tip**: Check the current herd members before zapping to gauge how much you might need to contribute to secure your spot
- **Stop crying**  Being headbutted out of the herd isn't permanent - you can always rejoin the next day or attempt to headbutt someone else with a larger zap!

## Daily Cycle

Remember:

- GM!
- The CyberHerd resets every day
- You must rejoin each day by reposting or zapping the new daily note
- Retards who zap or repost the wrong note can't get in.  Only the #cyberHerd tagged not for the current day will work
- All accumulated sats are distributed to herd members only when the feeder is triggered
- Your Lightning address must be functional to receive your share, obviously
- Join the CyberHerd daily to maximize your earnings and help support the ⚡Lightning Goats⚡!
- There may be bugs.  There will definitely be bugs.  There's only one guy coding this as a hobby for fun
